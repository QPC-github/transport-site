# NOTE: this file does _not_ define what is used in production
# (see https://github.com/etalab/transport-site/issues/1336), but it
# provides an easy way to ensure local development and test will rely on roughly
# the same versions as in production.

# It must be noted that the asdf-nodejs plugin is able
# to use both .tool-versions and this .nvmrc file
# (see https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs#nvmrc-and-node-version-files)
